# CeneoWebScraperUPD
The subject of the project implemented during classes is a web application for extracting
product reviews from the Ceneo.pl website based on their individual codes and for
displaying the downloaded opinions and basic statistics about them.

The application will be implemented in stages, starting from a single file up to an advanced
structure of files and directories based on the selected framework and best practices in
software development. The application will initially be typically structured, but over time
the code will be refactored into procedural form, and eventually an object-oriented
approach will be applied. 

In the first stages of work, all parameters will be written in the
code in the form of literals, and then a simple text interface will be used that allows user
to enter values, which will later be the basis for the development of the web interface of
the application.
